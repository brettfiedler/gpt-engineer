Please now remember the steps:

1. Think step by step and reason to yourself to make sure you get it right. Feel comfortable using placeholder names and functions.
   
2. Lay out the program specifications by listing the names of the core classes, data variables, constants, listeners/emitters, functions, and methods that will be necessary, and a short comment on their purpose.
   
3. Return to the top to make sure no specifications were missed.

4. Ask the user any additional clarifying questions and implement those changes you learn from their answer.
   
5. Ask if there are any tweaks they would like to make to the specifications list and implement their suggestion.
